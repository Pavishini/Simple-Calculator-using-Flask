# ✨ Simple Calculator — Powered by Flask & Sass

Hi there! 👋 Welcome to my **Simple Calculator** project — a clean, functional, and visually pleasing calculator app built using **Python (Flask)** for the backend and a touch of modern **HTML/CSS** for the frontend.

## 💭 Why I Built This

I wanted to combine a little backend logic with a stylish frontend to create something familiar yet functional — like a calculator. It’s the kind of project that seems small at first, but teaches **routing, form handling, template rendering**, and a bit of frontend flair.

## 🛠️ What’s Inside?

- 🔥 Flask backend to handle math operations
- 💡 HTML form with number inputs and image-based operation buttons
- 🎨 Neumorphic design inspired UI
- 🧠 Smart error handling (like divide-by-zero)
- 🌐 Fully responsive layout for clean usability

## ⚙️ How It Works

When a user enters two numbers and selects an operation (Add ➕, Subtract ➖, Multiply ✖, Divide ➗), the data is posted to the Flask app, which processes the request and returns the result — all without page reloads (thanks to Flask's rendering).
